### Stocks-Analysis

# Challenge Overview

Module 2 challenge was to refactor the Green Stocks VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. The goal for this challenge was to increase the efficiency of the original code.

# Results

My second try when refactoring the orginal code did yield better results in the processing of the code.

Here are the results when running the green_stock file
