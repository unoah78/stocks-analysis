### Stocks-Analysis

# Challenge Overview

Module 2 challenge was to refactor the Green Stocks VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. The goal for this challenge was to increase the efficiency of the original code.

# VBA Results

My second try when refactoring the orginal code did yield better results in the processing of the code.

Here are the results when running the green_stock file:

# VBA Pros/Cons

Believe the biggest advantage of using VBA in Excel is that if the code is properly written, it allows someone who doesnâ€™t know anything about Excel can perform the task by running the macro.

On the contrary the biggest disadvantage is that things can go wrong and you can not blindly assume the VBA code will always work correctly under all circumstances.

# Stock Summary

Overall 2017 stocks listed saw positive returns with the outlier being *TERP*, on the other hand 2018 stock returns show negative returns with the exception of *ENPH* and *RUN* stocks.
